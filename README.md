Contract_Authoring
==================

Designing a web application that employees can use to author contracts from a web app - rather than using Word or Excel.

I'm looking to start developing web apps for our company - as a brand manager, I am getting frustrated with our employees using word and excel to 
draw up contracts for customers.  My goal is to develop an app that allows ease-of-use for our employees to draw up contracts from a web app
that also conforms to my expectations regarding presentation to our customers.

Goals:

Ease of use for employees
Consistent look from a "print" process of finalized contracts - conforming to my expetected style.
Ability for multiple user-roles - Adminitrators, authors, and editors.

This will be my first web application (expecting a long process) - But I believe my concept would require a database to store
information regarding "accounts".  I would like the administrator to be able to create new accounts - these accounts will then store
contract information(which will be editable by the admins and authors).  

Editors will be able to make "notes" on the contracts - and what needs to be adjusted. And from a dashboard - authors and adminsitrators
will see what contracts have "pending" notes to change on the contracts.  And as they make the changes on the contracts - they can check the 
notes off - as completed tasks (that would be automatically added to a published change.log)

More to come...
